# ProjectEulerSolutions
I like math and programming. the former I am not good at ï¼›the latter I am learning . ProjectEuler is very challenging for me, so I created the project to record my journey. The project is mainly to solve the ProjectEuler challenge with Python. I will optimize the previous code,learn new math and algorithm in the  process, which will make me more powerful I believe, wuhahahahaha........
